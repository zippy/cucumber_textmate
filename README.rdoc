== A prettier HTML output designed for Textmate

Enhanced with javascript taken from rspec
Tested with {Cucumber}[http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/tree] 0.3.95 and {Textmate}[http://macromates.com] 1.5.8.
== Install

Just copy <tt>textmate_formatter.rb</tt> and <tt>cucumber-textmate.css</tt> to <tt>features/support/</tt>

Then add <tt>-f TextmateFormatter</tt> to your cucumber tmbundle or TM_CUCUMBER_OPTS variable
To have the full reporting from errors, also add <tt>-b</tt> to your TM_CUCUMBER_OPTS variable

== Notes

A lot of code taken from rspec and cucumber to make this so thanks to all involved.
A little messy at the moment so needs some love to tidy it up.
